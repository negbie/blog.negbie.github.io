      <description>Choosing a static site generator I was looking for something with which I can save some notes online and publish them. First I tried discourse as a well searchable knowledgebase. It was quite nice and you can get it running in a few minutes as a DigitalOcean droplet or docker container. But I&amp;rsquo;m not familiar with ruby and have to maintain still another os. After some time I came across static site generators.</description>
