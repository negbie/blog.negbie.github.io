# Static site generator Hugo

I was looking for something with which i can save some notes online and publish them. First i tried discourse as a well searchable knowledgebase. It was quite nice and you can get it running in a few minutes as a DigitalOcean droplet or docker container. But iâ€™m not familiar with ruby and i need to maintain still another os. After some time i came across github pages static site generators. First i tried hubpress which was to laggy for me. Jekyll and Octopress are written in ruby
